My newest preprint [Degree spectra of analytic complete equivalence
relations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.00755) just appeared on arXiv.

This article investigates the bi-embeddability and elementary
bi-embeddability relation on countable structures both from the
viewpoint of descriptive set theory and computable structure theory. Two
structures are *bi-embeddable* if either is isomorphic to an
substructure of the other. They are *elementary bi-embeddable* if either
is isomorphic to a elementary substructure of the other.

Our main results are the following.

**Theorem 1.** The elementary bi-embeddability relation on graphs is a
**Σ**<sub>1</sub><sup>1</sup> complete equivalence relation under Borel
reducibility.

The proof of this result uses Marker extensions with so called minimal
models. A structure 𝒜 is *minimal* if it does not contain an elementary
substructure.

Let ∼ be an equivalence relation on a class of structures. Then given a
structure 𝒜 we define the ∼ spectrum of 𝒜 as the set of all sets Turing
equivalent to a structure ∼ equivalent to 𝒜, i.e.,
*D**g**S**p*<sub>∼</sub>(𝒜) = {*X* ⊆ *ω* : ∃ℬ ∼ 𝒜 *X*≡<sub>*T*</sub>𝒜}.

**Theorem 2.** Every bi-embeddability spectrum of a graph is the jump
spectrum of an elementary bi-embeddability spectrum of a graph, i.e.,
for every 𝒢, there is a graph 𝒢′ such that
*D**g**S**p*<sub>≈</sub>(𝒢′) = {*X* : *X*′ ∈ *D**g**S**p*<sub>≊</sub>(𝒢)}.

This result is proven by analyzing the reduction given to prove Theorem
1. We show that this reduction induces a computable bi-transformation
with a suitable class of structures.
