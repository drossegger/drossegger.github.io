This project studies the structural complexity of foundational theories and investigates when a theory has an intended model. We use advances in Scott analysis and new techniques to understand how intendedness arises, and how model‑theoretic complexity can be detected by infinitary logic.

### Research questions
- Do foundational theories have a structurally simplest model, and is it the intended one?
- Can intendedness be characterized by other properties of the theory?
- How do Scott functions reflect model‑theoretic and descriptive‑set‑theoretic complexity?

### Approach
We combine tools from Scott analysis with methods from the foundations of mathematics. The project is interdisciplinary and international, with regular collaboration between the teams in Vienna and Warsaw.

### Funding
This project is funded by the Austrian Science Fund (FWF) and jointly by NCN. See the FWF project page: https://www.fwf.ac.at/forschungsradar/10.55776/PIN1878224
