### Fall 2020

I will be teaching MATH 137: Calculus 1 for Honors mathematics.

### Winter 2020
I taught PMATH 432: First Order Logic and Computability. A fourth year course in computability based mostly on the book Mathematical Logic by Ebbinghaus, Flum, and Thomas with an audience of approximately 25 students.
For the last part on the incompleteness theorems and computability theory I wrote my own notes: [pmath432_notes.pdf](/files/pmath432_notes.pdf)

### Fall 2019
I taught PMATH 330: Introduction to mathematical logic. A third year course introduction to logic. I designed the course myself and wrote my own notes: [pmath330_notes.pdf](/files/pmath330_notes.pdf)

### Teaching Praedoc
I held exercise sessions for first year courses in mathematics for computer scientists at TU Wien and theoretical computer science at University of Vienna. I also taught an introductory mathematics course to prepare students for their first year classes.
